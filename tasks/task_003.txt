# Task ID: 3
# Title: PWA Initial Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline capability and optimized asset caching.
# Details:
Add vite-plugin-pwa (v0.17.0+) to vite.config.ts. Configure manifest.json with name, icons, and start_url. Implement basic service worker caching, excluding large MP3s and ML models from precache using workbox.globIgnores.

# Test Strategy:
Build and serve the app, verify PWA install prompt appears and offline mode works. Check that excluded assets are not precached.
