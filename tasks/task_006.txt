# Task ID: 6
# Title: App.tsx Refactoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Break down App.tsx into smaller, reusable components to reduce complexity.
# Details:
Extract layout logic into MainLayout.tsx and SidePanels.tsx. Move Warp Mode logic into WarpStarfieldController.tsx, controlled by props/context. Use Zustand for shared state where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Verify UI renders correctly and all extracted components function as expected. Run E2E test to ensure no regression.
