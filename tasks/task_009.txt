# Task ID: 9
# Title: Audio Management Refactor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor audio state management to align with global state strategy.
# Details:
Review AudioProvider.tsx and MusicPlayer.tsx. Move current track, volume, shuffle, and session-only play state to Zustand (musicSlice.ts or appSlice). Simplify internal state management and HTMLAudioElement pooling.

# Test Strategy:
Test audio playback, volume, and shuffle controls. Verify state is accessible across the app via Zustand.
