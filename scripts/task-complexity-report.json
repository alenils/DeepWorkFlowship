      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository cleanup into: (1) Identifying duplicate/nested folders, (2) Deleting unnecessary folders, (3) Updating imports and references, (4) Cleaning git history, (5) Verifying in a fresh environment.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both file system operations and codebase-wide reference updates, which can introduce subtle issues if not handled carefully. It is moderately complex due to the need for thorough verification and potential git history rewriting."
