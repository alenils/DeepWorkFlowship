Document Version: 4.0
Date: MAY 26, 2025
Author/Owner: Alexander Nilsson
Status: Proposed

1. Introduction & Overview
1.1 Product Name: DeepWork Spacestation
1.2 What is DeepWork Spacestation?
DeepWork Spacestation is an immersive, offline-first, browser-based productivity dashboard designed to transform deep work sessions into an engaging and focused experience. Themed as a spaceship cockpit, it integrates a gamified focus timer, goal tracking, webcam-based posture monitoring, an in-app instrumental music player, a notepad, an action list, and an "AI Buddy" for motivation and task contextualization.
1.3 Problem Statement
Modern knowledge workers, students, and productivity enthusiasts constantly battle distractions, procrastination, and a lack of sustained motivation. The digital environment, while powerful, is often a primary source of these issues. Furthermore, managing focus often requires juggling multiple disparate tools for timers, task lists, music, and well-being reminders, leading to context switching and inefficiency. This fragmentation can make achieving deep work states feel like a chore rather than a rewarding process.
1.4 Proposed Solution
DeepWork Spacestation offers a unified, engaging, and gamified platform that consolidates essential productivity and well-being tools into a single, immersive browser-based experience. By theming the dashboard as a spaceship cockpit and incorporating elements like streaks, XP, and an AI Buddy, it aims to make deep work more enjoyable, reduce the friction of using multiple tools, and encourage sustained focus and better work habits. Its offline-first PWA nature ensures reliability and accessibility, regardless of internet connectivity.
1.5 Vision
To be the most engaging and effective platform for individuals seeking to master deep work, transforming productivity from a mundane task into an exciting journey of personal achievement and well-being.

5. Design & UX Considerations
5.1 Overall Design Philosophy:
	• Immersive & Thematic: The spaceship cockpit theme should be consistently applied across all UI elements, animations, and interactions to create a cohesive and engaging experience.
	• Gamified: Elements of game design (XP, streaks, rewards, story mode) should be thoughtfully integrated to enhance motivation without being distracting.
	• Functional & Minimalist (during focus): While immersive, the UI should prioritize clarity and minimize clutter, especially during active focus sessions, to prevent distraction.
5.2 Key UX Principles:
	• Offline-First & Reliable: The application must be dependable, with core functionality available even without an internet connection. State should be preserved.
	• Intuitive & Discoverable: Users should be able to understand and use core features with minimal instruction. Optional features should be easily discoverable.
	• Engaging & Rewarding: Interactions should feel satisfying. Progress should be visible and celebrated.
	• User Control & Customization: Provide options for users to tailor the experience to their preferences (e.g., music volume, starfield quality, posture sensitivity).
	• Performance: The application must be responsive and performant, avoiding jank or high resource usage that could detract from the user experience or drain battery.
5.3 Accessibility (A11y):
	• The application will strive to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.
	• Key considerations: Keyboard navigability, prefers-reduced-motion support, ARIA attributes for custom controls, sufficient color contrast (challenging with immersive UIs, may require high-contrast mode), and screen reader compatibility for dynamic announcements.
6. Future Considerations / Roadmap (Post-MVP)
While the MVP focuses on delivering a core, polished experience, future iterations may explore:
	• Side Quests: Smaller, trackable tasks related to main goals.
	• Dedicated Pause Timer (for Breaks): Automated break timing for Pomodoro cycles.
	• On-boarding / First-Visit Wizard: Guided tour for new users.
	• Extended Story Mode via AI Buddy Chat: Deeper, evolving narratives.
	• Mouth Breathing Alarm & Phone Pickup Alert: Advanced webcam-based wellness/distraction features.
	• Break Meter & "Oxygen Level": Conceptual wellness reminders.
	• Multiplayer / Productivity Battle: Synchronous focus sessions with others.
	• Advanced Starfield & Planet Fly-bys: Enhanced visuals.
7. Open Questions / Risks
	• Performance on Low-End Devices: Balancing immersive visuals (Starfield, Posture Tracking) with performance on less powerful hardware will be crucial. Quality settings and fallbacks are key mitigations.
	• Local LLM Performance & Utility: The utility and speed of the chosen "Tiny-LLM" models (DistilGPT-2/Phi-2) need to be validated. Model loading time and inference speed are critical.
	• Posture Tracker Accuracy & Calibration: Ensuring the posture tracker is reasonably accurate and the calibration process is user-friendly will impact its adoption. False positives for nudges could be frustrating.
	• Music Licensing: For MVP, ensuring any bundled music is royalty-free and properly licensed is essential if distributing beyond personal use.
	• User Adoption of Immersive Theme: While a differentiator, the strong theme might not appeal to all potential users. The core productivity tools must be solid regardless.

This PRD should provide a clear vision for the DeepWork Spacestation MVP. Let me know your thoughts!
